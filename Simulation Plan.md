# The Simulation Argument
Why some people think this isn't real life, and instead a simulation.

#### Structure
* We've questioned whether this is reality for as long as we can remember
  * Descartes- *"I think therefore I am"*
  * Brain in the Vat
  * The Matrix + The Truman Show
  * None are rooted in fact/science
* But with new scientific advancements in physics, quantum physics, the idea that this isn't real life is starting to become ever more convincing.
  * Elon Musk, Nick Bostrom, and other tech geniuses believe this world isn't real.
  * Why? Rooted in problems in physics (Concession- I did my best to understand this stuff, but it's pretty complicated so I apologize if I mess up the concepts)
    * **The Big Bang**- how did something come out of nothing? Defeats the law of conservation of energy (research this more). If we think of the world in terms of a computer simulation, this makes perfect sense, as a computer boots up there is no space-time before it, but it's there afterwards.  
    * **Speed Limit**- Why do we have a speed limit, with nothing able to go faster than light. It seems pretty arbitrary, and while some point to the weightlessness in photons, no one has a concrete answer to why this is our speed limit. If we think of the world as a computer simulation, this makes sense as
