# The Simulation Argument
Why some people think this isn't real life, and instead an elaborate computer simulation.

#### Structure
1. We've questioned whether this is reality for as long as we can remember
  * Descartes- *"I think therefore I am"*
  * Brain in the Vat
  * The Matrix + The Truman Show
  * None are rooted in fact/science
2. But with new scientific advancements in physics, quantum physics, the idea that this isn't real life is starting to become ever more convincing.
  * Elon Musk, Nick Bostrom, and other tech geniuses believe this world isn't real.
  * Why? Rooted in problems in physics (Concession- I did my best to understand this stuff, but it's pretty complicated so I apologize if I mess up the concepts)
    * **The Big Bang**- how did something come out of nothing? Defeats the law of conservation of energy (research this more). If we think of the world in terms of a computer simulation, this makes perfect sense, as a computer boots up there is no space-time before it, but it's there afterwards.  
    * **Speed Limit**- Why do we have a speed limit, with nothing able to go faster than light. It seems pretty arbitrary, and while some point to the weightlessness in photons, no one has a concrete answer to why this is our speed limit. If we think of the world as a computer simulation, this makes sense as computers can only have finite processors.
    * **The Observer Effect**- When we go to the quantum level, we see that electrons sometimes look like waves, and other times like particles, and only changed when they were observed. Watching/observing something changes observed reality, which doesn't make sense in a materialistic viewpoint, but makes perfect sense if we assume this world is virtual.
    * **Nature of The Universe is Digital**- James Gates has seen computer code in superposition (research more)
    * Not even talking about nonlocality, something which Einstein spent 30 years on and couldn't mangle with the materialistic view of the world.
3. There is compelling evidence that we may be living in a computer simulation, but how would we have gotten here? Who created the simulation?
  * The argument made is that *we* created the simulation. Not exactly us, but a previous version of us.
  * Right now our processing power is doubling every 1-2 years (18 months), and has been for decades.
  * 40 years ago we had Pong, but today we have photo-realistic VR, almost indistinguishable from reality. Some say in 50 years we'll have the ability to create a computer with the processing power of every human brain on the planet combined. Whether it takes 50 years, or 50 million years, we're heading on to this path.
  * This computer would have the ability to create ancestor simulations (read more into this)
  * So if we have the ability in the future to create ancestor simulations, either to analyze our past history and see how it would be different if certain historical events never occurred, someone would build it (like a model train enthusiast).
  * If they create this simulation, then the people in that simulation would eventually be able to, after a certain amount of technological progress, be able to create ancestor simulations of their own. And those people in that simulation would be able to as well, and so on.
  * So if all of this is true, then what's the chance that we're the first species to create the simulation? What's the most likely scenario is that we're a part of a simulation, as the number of computer simulations would vastly outnumber the one true reality.
4. But there are two caveats where the simulation would have never been created.
  * We never get to that point of technological advancement because we die out from nuclear war, global warming, some existential threat.
  * We choose not to make simulations b/c of moral or ethical reasons (the people in the simulation could still experience pain). What's the point? I think this point is less likely, but it's still out there.
5. How could we test it?
6. Does it matter?
