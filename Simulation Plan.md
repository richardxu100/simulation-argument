## Historical Context
We've questioned whether this is reality for as long as we can remember, it's been a major question for philosophers for 1000's of years. Descartes, the father of western democracy, wondered about reality heavily, stating "I think, therefore I am", that he can only know he's real because he's aware of his thoughts, but can't be sure that everything else isn't. Why? What we perceive to be reality is through our senses, touch, taste, smell, hear, which are simply electrical signals to our brain. Descartes posited that some Evil Demon could be in control of our brains, creating an illusory world to deceive us, but that we could really never know.

Over the years, philosophers have modernized Descartes ideas into the brain in the vat argument, which states that right now, our brains could be in some jar/vat, hooked up into a computer program which simulates our outside world perfectly through electrical signals.

This premise was the driving force behind *The Matrix*, which spoiler alert is a great movie that you should still watch, but stated that the entire human race has been placed into vats and fed a computer simulation, controlled by evil artificial intelligence which uses their bodies as an energy source.

None of these arguments can be disproven, but still none of them are backed up by science or fact.

What is real, but simply things that we can feel, touch, taste, smell, through our senses. What we perceive to be real is through our senses, which just transmits electrical signals to our brain, so why couldn't everything we experience just be fabricated, created to deceive us by what Descartes called, an Evil Demon.
* Descartes- *"I think therefore I am"*
* Brain in the Vat
* The Matrix
* None are rooted in fact/science

### Why Now?
But with new scientific advancements in physics, quantum physics, and problems that we have today that even Einstein couldn't figure out, the idea that this isn't real life is starting to become ever more convincing.

* Elon Musk, Nick Bostrom, and other tech geniuses believe this world isn't real.
* Why? Rooted in problems in physics (Concession- I did my best to understand this stuff, but it's pretty complicated so I apologize if I mess up the concepts)
  * **The Big Bang**- [Big bang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNDGgL73ihYhow) did something come out of nothing? Defeats the law of conservation of energy (research this more). If we think of the world in terms of a computer simulation, this makes perfect sense, as a computer boots up there is no space-time before it, but it's there afterwards.  
  * **Speed Limit**- Why do we have a speed limit, with nothing able to go faster than light. It seems pretty arbitrary, and while some point to the weightlessness in photons, no one has a concrete answer to why this is our speed limit. If we think of the world as a computer simulation, this makes sense as computers can only have finite processors.
  * **The Observer Effect**- To explain this concept, I'll use a thought experiment you may have heard of called Schrodinger's cat. So let's say you put a cat in a box with a bomb that has a 50% chance to kill the cat in the next hour. At the end of the hour, is the cat dead or alive? Common sense would say that the cat is either alive or dead. But according to quantum physics, at the instant before the cat is opened, the cat is equal parts alive and dead at the same time. Only when we open the box do we know the cat's definite state, before then it's just probability. This can be seen in the quantum world with electrons. When you observe an electron, it looks like a wave, when you don't, it looks like a particle. Watching can change reality. Quantum objects such as electrons can be in two states at once, called superposition, which makes no sense when thinking this is the material world, but makes perfect sense if we assume this world is virtual.
  * **Nature of The Universe is Digital**- James Gates has seen computer code in superposition (research more)
  * Not even talking about nonlocality, something which Einstein spent 30 years on and couldn't mangle with the materialistic view of the world.

## How the Argument Works
There is compelling evidence that we may be living in a computer simulation, but how would we have gotten here? Who created the simulation?
* The argument made is that *we* created the simulation. Not exactly us, but a previous version of us.
* Right now our processing power is doubling every 1-2 years (18 months), and has been for decades.
* 40 years ago we had Pong, but today we have photo-realistic VR, almost indistinguishable from reality. Some say in 50 years we'll have the ability to create a computer with the processing power of every human brain on the planet combined. Whether it takes 50 years, or 50 million years, we're heading on to this path.
* This computer would have the ability to create ancestor simulations (read more into this)
* So if we have the ability in the future to create ancestor simulations, either to analyze our past history and see how it would be different if certain historical events never occurred, someone would build it (like a model train enthusiast).
* If they create this simulation, then the people in that simulation would eventually be able to, after a certain amount of technological progress, be able to create ancestor simulations of their own. And those people in that simulation would be able to as well, and so on.
* So if all of this is true, then what's the chance that we're the first species to create the simulation? What's the most likely scenario is that we're a part of a simulation, as the number of computer simulations would vastly outnumber the one true reality.

## Two Caveats
But there are two caveats where the simulation would have never been created.
* We never get to that point of technological advancement because we die out from nuclear war, global warming, some existential threat.
* We choose not to make simulations b/c of moral or ethical reasons (the people in the simulation could still experience pain). What's the point? I think this point is less likely, but it's still out there.
