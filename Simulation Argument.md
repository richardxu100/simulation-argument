## Simulation Argument Research
#### What do people need to know?                                                                                             
* What the Simulation Argument Is
    * The universe is huge, so there’s a huge probability that life exists out there. Drake’s equation: billions of planets could support life, around 100,000 civilizations in our galaxy (not to talk about the entire universe (trillions)) though we haven’t come across it b/c of Fermi’s Paradox (filters: climate change, nuclear weapons, advanced technologies), our communication is too primitive like morse code, only been communicating for 50 years). Because of the almost certainty that there is and at least was intelligent life, and with our development of computers and virtual reality, who’s to say someone couldn’t simulate the universe sometime in the future? Moore’s Law makes it so our processing power doubles every 2 years, it’s not stopping anytime soon. But this also brings up another question: can we simulate a conscious human being. Well what’s consciousness: awareness.
    * Argument says, because of the pre-requisite understandings, there is a large possibility that we’re just the simulated result of some super intelligent species. Of course there are two other possibilities that may be true however: advanced species never make it that far b/c of some cataclysmic event such as global warming or nuclear weapons. The other is that the advanced species doesn’t choose to make simulations b/c it’s unethical, or they’re not interested. In all other scenarios, it’s almost a guarantee that we’re in a simulation, cause of the rabbit hole and low chance of being in base reality (who’s to say we’re first?).
    * Can we simulate the universe?  
    * In the last 40 years, we went from Pong to photo-realistic VR. Moore’s law, doubling power. According to Drake’s paradox, it’s almost a certainty that there is intelligent life out there (fermi’s paradox exception).
    * Some of these advanced civilizations will have beat us to it and had the power to create a simulation of the universe.
    * If you believe that there is intelligent life out there, that it’s possible to simulate consciousness and therefore our finite universe, then you must agree with one of three scenarios.
        * First, that we blow ourselves up before achieving the processing power to simulate reality.
        * Second, that advanced civilizations choose not to make simulations
        * Third, we’re almost certainly in a simulation (we’re so young, that the biggest chance is that someone beat us to it). If we are able to build a simulation, then we’re in one right now, like the matrix.  
* Why people trust it
    * Some trust it because they’ve watched the Matrix and think its cool.
    * There’s bugs that we see (not deja vu), but quantum physics is all out of wack. Others contend that these super intelligent beings wouldn’t ever make these mistakes. Trying to throw us off.  
* The faults in the argument
    * Why would the creator make life so shitty for so many people?
* Does it matter?
    * It matters. Talk about Aristotle. There is a war on knowledge. How crazy does it seem like the earth is round?
    * As humans, we’re certain of stuff, and that severely limits us.  
    * Scout mindset, war against knowledge.
    * This seems crazy, but we’ve been wrong a lot before. Science is the pursuit of being less and less wrong. We can never be certain.

#### Makes two assumption.
1. There's a huge chance that we're not the only advanced species in the universe. So there's a lot of advanced civilizations out there.
2. With the rate of our technological progress, we can simulate the universe, it's finite.

Descartes- I think therefore I am.

The question I was trying to answer is why do these men think we're living in a computer simulation. They're smart people.

What's the deal is that we're getting to a point where we had pong 40 years ago, and now we have photo-realistic VR. Some say we'll have a computer with more processing power than all the brains in the world combined by the middle of this century (Moore's Law), and that this machine would be able to run "ancestor simulations", which simulate our evolutionary history with virtual people with virtual nervous systems.  If this is the case, then we'd develop a posthuman race.

Imagine this, we're the first generation to create it. But wait, then those people could create simulations too. And so on. Who's to say some humans didn't do that before us??

Look, 40 years ago we had pong, but today we have photo-realistic VR. Our processing power is doubling every 18 months or so, according to Moore's Law. Some say we'll have a computer with more processing power than all the brains in the world combined by the middle of this century, and that this machine would be able to run "ancestor simulations", which simulate our evolutionary history with virtual people with virtual nervous systems. Whether this takes 50 years or 5 million years, we're on the path to doing so. If this is the case, then someone out there would create a simulation. Maybe some guy, who builds like model trains or plays the Sims. But it would be created. And if we build it, who's to say that the simulated civilization doesn't go on to develop the technology to create simulations too. And so on. If this is the case, who's to say we're not the products of a computer simulation as well? That there's not some posthuman race before us.

#### Now there are two scenarios where this argument would be false.
1. We never get to that point of technological advancement because we die out from nuclear war, global warming.
2. We choose not to make simulations b/c of moral or ethical reasons. What's the point.

So we can't be for certain.

Of course, two other scenarios are possible!

Would have thought of as crazy, but now it's taken as really seriously. Cutting-edge physics say our universe isn't an objective reality.

* Democritus, only the atom is real.
* Consciousness is the result of physical processes in the brain.
* Is this a virtual world? Simulation hypothesis (universe is a virtual construct, needs processing outside of space-time)
* Can we hack reality?

#### Problems
* How did the big bang work? Something coming out of nothing.
	* Virtual worlds, when they boot up, mimic the big bang. No space-time before the boot up, something from nothing.
* Every computer generated image breaks down into pixels when examined closely, same thing in nature. Everything is made out of bits, universe is computable.
	* The nature of the universe could be digital
* James Gates (theoretical physicist), has found computer code, strings of 10's in super symmetry.
* Why is there a speed limit? Nothing has gone faster than the speed of light. Events in a virtual world also have a max speed b/c of finite processor.
* Quantum theory, nonlocality. Einstein, 3 decades trying to solve materialism. Entanglement. Virtual world makes sense. Distance doesn't limit correspondence. All points in a computer game are at an equal distance from the processor, nonlocality is solved by simulation. Space is just an illusion.
* The Observer Effect (observing something, we see particles. Not looking, we see waves).
	* Odd, but like computer simulation. We get the frame when we're looking at a place, navigating around we're given another frame (our world seems pixelated)
	* Double slit experiment
* Reality comes from quantum. Quantum realm, and bigger realm aren't different
* All of these taken together mean something.
* Niels Bohr: "Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real."

So first talk about the problems of the world, which led to the simulation argument (it looks like we're in a game of sims, but how did this come to be?). Then talk about the argument (this isn't reality). And then moral considerations.
