## Simulation Argument Speech

#### Structure
* We've questioned our reality for so long, but now we have some evidence (physics is all out of wack)
* What is physics? The study of how things happen, and why? 
	* Big Bang
	* Nature of universe is digital (James Gates)
	* Speed limit (why?), because we have finite processors.
	* Nonlocality
	* The Observer Effect
* So there's compelling evidence that our world is virtual, but how did this come to be?
* The Simulation Argument
	* Look, 40 years ago we had pong, but today we have photo-realistic VR. Our processing power is doubling every 18 months or so, according to Moore's Law. Some say we'll have a computer with more processing power than all the brains in the world combined by the middle of this century, and that this machine would be able to run "ancestor simulations", which simulate our evolutionary history with virtual people with virtual nervous systems. Whether this takes 50 years or 5 million years, we're on the path to doing so. If this is the case, then someone out there would create a simulation. Maybe some guy, who builds like model trains or plays the Sims. But it would be created. And if we build it, who's to say that the simulated civilization doesn't go on to develop the technology to create simulations too. And so on. If this is the case, who's to say we're not the products of a computer simulation as well? That there's not some posthuman race before. Humanity created this.
	* Moore's Law, our processing power doubles every 18 months. We had pong 40 years ago, but today we have photo-realistic VR. 
		* If this keeps going on, we take
	* Now there are two scenarios where this argument would be false.
		* We never get to that point of technological advancement because we die out from nuclear war, global warming.
		* We choose not to make simulations b/c of moral or ethical reasons. What's the point.
* How can we test this argument?
	* A window pop-up saying we're in a simulation
	* Existential risks of advanced species are too large
* Ethical Implications (Does this matter?)
